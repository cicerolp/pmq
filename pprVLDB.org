Plan for a VLDB paper.

* Contex
Data-structure for In-memory, Geo-spatial, Streaming data, range-queries

** Geospatial data
Tree based DS: 
- R-tree : 2D index
- B-tree : 1D index -> using Z-index

** Streaming
Trees than can insert and delete efficiently

** Operations
- Insertion
- Temporal Deletions
- Range Queries

** How to do a range Query? 
Search Key inside a bounding box;

- R-Tree: Support it natively?

- B-Tree / 1D Z-order: Two steps
  - Convert a 2D range into n 1D ranges
  - find each range in the B-tree

** Problem of R-Tree / B-tree
- Ages very fast, data gets fragmentes in memory.
  - Range queries tend to degrade very fast. (*TO CONFIRM*) 

- maintaining pointers as overhead of storage cost. 
  
* PMQ 
** Proposal
- Z-order in a PMA
- range-queries = Binary Search O(log n).

** Advantages
Range-Queries are more eficient in a PMA . 

B-Trees age very fast and suffer from fragmentation in memoruy (does it happens in R-tree too? ) 

** Disadvantage
- It's an amortized data structure. Some operations are slower than others. 

* Open questions

** Range queries - query by geografic coordinates ? 
- Should we use the data with latitude / longitude , or with grid coordinates? 

R-tree can handle the latitude/longitude directly. 
Geohash converts it to "tile" coordinates of fixed resolution. 

- Quering in geohash grid has a fixed resolution. 

>> *Solution* limit the lat / lon precision to same precision of the geohash. 

note: Avoind checking the (lat,lon) of each element in the refined quadrant.

** Comparisons with state of the art ( *Fractal Tree* ? ) 

- Fractal Tree :: Based on BIB:bender2007a (cache-oblivious streaming B-trees)
                  
  - implemented in Tokutek Db / Precona
  - BTree + PMA ? 
  - Made for disk access. 
    

Streamin B-trees =  "A dictionary with efficient Insertion and Range queries. "

*** What is the difference with PMQ ?

What is difference between this Fractal Tress with a PMA + Z-curve?

- We have a batch insertion PMA.

*** TODO Check this assumptions
- Pointer and explicit tree management might be an overhead. 
- Doest it realy has a pointer-base tree , or is it linearized ? 

*** TODO Can we run their benchmarks for comparison
https://github.com/Tokutek/ft-index


** How to do the refinement of the "quadtree" using geohash only
NOSQL, <key,value> databases like redis support geohash operations.
Check if their algorithm do something more clever that what we do. 

Example: Redis

** How to implement temporal deletion on R-Tree / B-tree? 

** R-tree vs B-tree

- R-tree > B-tree
- R-tree supports 2D queries natively
- B-tree needs to linearize the index first. 

* Task List
** INPROGRESS Implementation R-tree                                :@CICERO:
- Using boost R-tree
- Several optimization parameters

*** DONE Insertion and deletions

*** TODO Temporal Deletes                                         
- Do a query 
- Delete all the deletions

** TODO Implementation B-tree                                      :@CICERO:

Use implementaion of =stx:Btree=
https://panthema.net/2007/stx-btree/
https://github.com/bingmann/stx-btree

Used in the benchmark comparison of BIB:Sewall2011

** TODO Check code from Fractal-Tree                                :@JULIO:

*** TODO Test the performance of the Streaming Btree from BIB:Bender2007a
** TODO Read detail of BIB:Bender2007a
** TODO Review how to compute GEOHASH eficiently from Lat / Lon.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash

What is a good geohashing query algorithm
- Redis ( Check if I can get their implementation) 
- look at open source implementations of geohashes

** TODO See how are the geohash implementations in Key-value store DB
Geohash implementation on Redis no-sql
https://redis.io/commands/geohash

https://karussell.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/spatial-keys-memory-efficient-geohashes/

- Elastic Search:
  
  Standard GEoHash ? 
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/geohashes.html
  
  Quatrees ? 
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-shape.html#prefix-trees


** TODO Check algorithm to convert 2D -> 1D index

Eu cho que os DB baseados em B-tree escaneiam todos os ids entre os Ids da bounding box

(não fazem o refinamento de quadtree)

Idéa: algoritmo hibrido entre refinamento de quadtree e scan linear de geohash.

** TODO Any Example of Streaming application using Geohash ? 

** TODO Definition of a Key-value store
We are dealing with data stored as <key,value>
